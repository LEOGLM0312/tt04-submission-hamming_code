  how_it_works: |
      The project consists of two parts, including a (11,7) hamming code encoder connected to an UART Transimitter and a decoder connected to an UART receiver. The encoder and decoder share the same set of input/output ports. They can be switch by inserting an impulse at ui_in[0].The encoder adds four parity bits to a sequence of parallel data. The UART transimitter rearranges and sends the coded data in series. The UART receiver receives msg in series and convert it to parallel for. Finally, the decoder decode the msg and correct potential error, and output the original msg.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      The encoder can be tested by inserting a sequence of parallel data and see whether the output data in series is coded correctly. For the decoder, input can be a sequence of coded data in series, with at most one bit error, and see whether the decoder can output the correct data.
